# Overview
Brief description of how binary data is formatted into DNA

# Description
DNA stores data in base 4. Instead of numbers, it uses 4 chemical bases: "adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C)" (Latchesar). In a binary form, each digit is either a 1 or 0. In a quarternary system, however, there are 4 possible digits: 0, 1, 2, and 3. This allows twice as much data per "bit".
| DNA | Quarternary | Binary |
| --- | ----------- | ------ |
| A   | 0           | 00     |
| T   | 1           | 01     |
| G   | 2           | 10     |
| C   | 3           | 11     |

A quarternary digit doesen't have a name in the sense that a binary digit would be a bit or a ternary digit would be a trit. ~~However, 2 binary digits _crumb_, so quarternary digits will be referred to as such.~~

# Addendum 001 - 9/1/2022
_Crumbs_ are for binary digits only. Quarternary digits are inferred to be _quartits_.
