# AP Research/Science Research Ethics Training

This training is a required component of the AP Research and Science Research course. Upon completion, students will have knowledge of the importance of and ways to conduct research that meets ethical guidelines. You must complete all sections of the training.  Answer the questions in your PREP document or logbook.

## Introduction:
1. Why do you think following ethical guidelines in research is important? How can this affect research studies?  
Following ethical guidelines in research is important because it is required to conduct valid research and protect what is being studied, such as a person. This can affect research studies by affecting the validity of the results.

## Scientific Integrity:
1. What is scientific integrity and why is it important in research?  
Scientific integrity is maintaining a generally agreed upon quality. It is important in research because it prevents misconduct in research.

2. What are some ways you will maintain scientific integrity?  
Scientific integrity is maintained by avoiding fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism.

## Data Acquisition and Management:
1. Explain the three categories of scientific data. Which one(s) will be the most relevant to your research? Why? The three categories of scientific data are experimental protocol, primary data, and procedures of reduction and analysis.  
Primary data is the most relevant, in that it contains the most intensively collected information.

2. What data are you planning to collect? How can a good research record help your research?  
I am planning on collecting performance data, as well as the methodology and environment in which the performance data is collected. A good research record allows easy sharing of data in an organized manner.

## Publication and Authorship:
1. Do you plan to publish your research? Why or why not?  
I plan to publish my research. I plan to do this because philosophically I believe in free and open source information.

2. In what ways do you think your research will bring new information to the field?  
My research will bring new information by collecting and organizing performance of lossless data compression algorithms.

## Mentor/Trainee Relationships:
1. Who are some mentors, or expert advisers, you can utilize for your research? How will you go about contacting them?  
I could email various professors or researchers that have research experience in data compression and algorithm design.

## Collaborative Science:
1. Although your research for this course is individual, there are some benefits to collaboration during the research process. What types of collaboration do you think would be beneficial to your study?  
Collaboration by sharing resource and ideas could be beneficial to study.

2. IRB approval is required for this course, and done through our science research program. This is to ensure your participants are protected. Do you think your research could be considered harmful to participants? If so, how can you minimize this harm? Is there any benefit to your participants being part of the study? If so, what benefits?  
I do not think research could be considered harmful to participants. There are no benefits to participating as a subject, because no living beings are being studied.


## Human and Animal Subjects:
1. What will you have to do to ensure IBR approval for your study?  
Minimize risk and maximize benefits when engaging in study; ensure equitable selection; ensure informed consent; and ensure privacy, confidentiality, and safeguards for the subject.

2. What are your responsibilities for engaging in human subjects research? You are required to have IRB approval for your research.
Are you using animals in your research? If so, what do you need to do to ensure approval? Can you use any alternatives, like are suggested in the module?  
I am not using animals in my research.

## Conflict of Interest and Commitment:
1. Define conflict of interest. How might this affect your research?  
Person interest is exploiting your position for personal gain. This could prevent objectivity of research and violate scientific integrity.

## Final Reflection:
1. Now that you have completed the ethical research training, what will you do to ensure your research meets ethical guidelines?  
I plan to ensure ethical guidelines by maintaining scientific integrity and ensuring ethical behavior in research.
