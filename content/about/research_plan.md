1. Title: Lossless Compression in a Quarternary System
2. Question or Problem Being Addressed: This provides an algorithm for translating and compressing binary data into a usable format for 
biological data storage.
3. Engineering Goals: Develop an efficient lossless compression algorithm for quarternary systems, as well as a simulation environment to compare to a lossless binary compression system.
4. Rationale: With the advent data storage within DNA, new data translation and compression algorithms need to be developed. With efficient compression in a DNA-based storage system, the quickly-expanding storage requirements can be met and exceeded.
5. Materials List
    - OMEN by HP Laptop 16-c0xxx
6. Procedures for Experiment Steps
   1. Source data sets to translate and compress
   2. Develop a simulation environment
   3. Develop metric-calculation procedures to compare possible translation-compression when compressing sourced data sets
   4. Develop multiple translation-compression algorithms
   5. Create data metrics of translation-compression algorithms in reference to compressing sourced data sets
   6. Compare data metrics
7. Data Analysis: Compression Ratio, Runtime Length, and a ratio between the two will be compared between algorithms.
