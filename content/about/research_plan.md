1. Title: Lossless Compression in a Quarternary System
2. Question or Problem Being Addressed: This provides an algorithm for translating and compressing binary data into a usable format for 
biological data storage.
3. Engineering Goals: Develop an efficient lossless compression algorithm for quarternary systems, as well as a simulation environment to compare to a lossless binary compression system.
4. Rationale: With the advent data storage within DNA, new data translation and compression algorithms need to be developed. With efficient compression in a DNA-based storage system, the quickly-expanding storage requirements can be met and exceeded.

6. Procedures for Experiment Steps
   1. Source data sets to test.
   2. Develop an environment to simulate data read and writes and to calculate metrics.
   3. Develop metric-calculation procedures to compare algorithms when compressing sourced data sets. These would compare error checking, runtime, and comrpession ratio. 
   4. Develop multiple translation-compression algorithms
      1. Develop a genetic evolution based model for taking components - error checking methods, translation methods, and compression methods - and building testable algorithm models.
      2. Develop algorithm "components" - error checking methods, translation methods, and compression methods.
      3. Utilize the genetic evolution based model to generate testable algorithms
   5. Calculate data metrics by simulating usage of the algorithm within the test environment
   6. Compare data metrics
7. Data Analysis: Compression Ratio, Runtime Length, and a ratio between the two will be compared between algorithms.
